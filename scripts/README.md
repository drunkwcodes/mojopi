# Muse, the mojo project developing ~~master~~ manager


### Motivation:

Muse is inspired from rust/cargo and python pdm. It will take care of mojo projects from project init to final product release.

### Current consideration

Though this project is big, but pdm is also one-man project. This encourages me a lot.

I would like to take the first step in mojo packaging, and seek for help of maintainance and issue resolving.

I'm reading pip's resolution library now.
I have resolvelib and pdm's implementation to implement mojo package manager first, and do the project initialization after.
